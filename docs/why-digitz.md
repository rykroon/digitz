# Why Digitz?


The [phonenumbers](https://pypi.org/project/phonenumbers/) library for Python has long been a trusted solution for phone number validation, formatting, and parsing, built on top of [Google's libphonenumber](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber). While its accuracy and reliability are unquestionable, the library has been slow to embrace modern Python practices, often feeling like it's stuck in the past.

`digitz` is a fresh take on phone number handling, designed to bring modern Python features and best practices to the world of phone number processing. If you've ever struggled with the verbose syntax or outdated API design of the phonenumbers library, `digitz` is here to change that.
